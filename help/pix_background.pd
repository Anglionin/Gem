comparing a static image in memory to an incoming video stream. all
values withing a given range are turned black. for best effect \, place
a camera on a static scene like a blank wall and hit 'reset'. then
set the range control to cover any variance in the background. when
a new object enters the scene it will be the only thing draw against
a black background. use pix_chroma_key or pix_compare to add in images
in place of the black.;
